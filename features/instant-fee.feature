Feature: Instant transfer fee
  As a customer of Stejar Bank
  I want to know the fee of an instant transfer before I confirm it
  So that I am charged the published tariff

  Acceptance criteria (product decision pending, see docs/fee-rules.md):
  - a retail customer pays the standard fee plus a flat fee of MDL 10.00
  - a premium customer pays the standard fee only, the flat fee is waived
  - an instant transfer above MDL 100,000.00, or the equivalent in EUR, is rejected
  - an EUR amount is converted to MDL first, then the MDL rule applies

  Background:
    Given the fee service is running
    And the EUR to MDL exchange rate is 19.8765

    When a retail customer asks for the fee of an instant transfer of MDL <amount>
    Then the response status is 200
    And the fee is MDL <fee>

    Examples: standard fee plus MDL 10.00

  Scenario Outline: Instant transfer above the limit is rejected
    When a <segment> customer asks for the fee of an instant transfer of <currency> <amount>
    Then the response status is 422
    And the error is "limit exceeded"

    Examples:
